As a result of Board discussions during the 2003 WCCA Annual Meeting, the WCCA funds were split into two independent WCCA accounts. The existing account was rolled-over into a Scholarship funds account. The funds in that account amount to $8237.00 as of the 31st of October 2003. A secondary checking account was established for the ongoing expenses associated with the Annual Meeting (San-I-Cans, Dumpster, Liability Insurance, Idanha Field Donation, Willamette National Forest, Ice Chests, etc). The balance in the latter is somewhat under $500. In total, our current assets are around $8700, and we remain a viable entity.<br><br>
Future donors will need to indicate to which fund they are donating. Unless the donation is specifically addressed to the Scholarship Fund, it will be added to the General Membership fund to underwrite ongoing expenses. In addition, the Board retains the authority to move funds between accounts to meet financial obligations as voted by the membership.<br><br>
