As many of you know, Shelley Gowell spearheaded the t-shirt project this past summer. The t-shirts were made available for the 2003 Fishing Trip. They were designed by B-Line Designs and were ordered through Textile Graphics in McMinnville. There were 97 shirts ordered in a mossy green in various sizes including one XXL, ten XL, 24 L, 39 M 15 S and also a few kid's shirts. The shirts were 100% heavyweight cotton. At this point in time there are 6 mediums left. The shirts were enthusiastically received. We priced the shirts at $8.00, of which $2.00 went to the newly created scholarship fund.<br><br>
Another shirt will be available for FT 2004 and your design ideas are welcome. Folks had some interest in a long sleeve tee for something different. Please email Shelley at sgowell@onlinemac.com with your ideas or suggestions.<br><br>
A t-shirt was sent to Wayne Sommes, and here is his response:

<i>Thanks very much for the t-shirt. The design is really great. I feel very privileged to be able to wear it. I really enjoy working and visiting with the group every year. It's a high point of my summer. <br>
Take care,<br>
Wayne.</i>
